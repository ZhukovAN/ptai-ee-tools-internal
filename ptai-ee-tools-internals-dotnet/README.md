Module reads vulnerability descriptions from PT AI vulnerability descriptions repository DLL and saves those to JSON file. As these descriptions are to be used as "rules" for SonarQube plugin, FP vulnerabilities are ignored as we do not need to create standalone rule for each CVE but the only rule like "Use of 3rd party vulnerable component" (see OWASP Dependency checker SonarQube plugin for example). This module also fills "language" multivalued field for PM issues as that data exists in repository
